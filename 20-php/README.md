# Laravel Gamification

Create a Laravel game using a genre/fandom/series of your choice

The app *MUST* create characters, update their stats and be able to delete (CRUD). The roster of characters will be attacking a fixed enemy (IE not each other). You can decide how many hitpoints this enemy has, and what happens after they win or die. 
 
 When each character attacks, the enemy SHOULD counter attack. When a character dies, it should be removed from the roster. 

Characters SHOULD contain
 * Name
 * Hitpoints
 * Health
 * ETC.
 
## Charaters *MUST* be able to
* Create
* Edit
* Update / Rename / ETC.
* Delete
* Attack a fixed enemy

## Character Suggested Actions
* Attach
* Health Pack
* Power Attack

## Enemy  
* Health
* Counter Attack points
## Enemy Actions
* Revive / Reset health
* Other actions - Kill All ?
 
  
# Part 2 - Bonus

## Create a `Stage` for battle between two characters
  * This will allow you to create a new view to let the two chosen characters battle it out!
  
## Create character classes that have different abilities
## Have power moves
