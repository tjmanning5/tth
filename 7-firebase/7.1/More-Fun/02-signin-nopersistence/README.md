#Instructions
* Using the [`2-student-do-signin-no-persistence`](2-student-do-signin-no-persistence.html) as a starting point, fill in the JavaScript code necessary to make the page "save user inputs" and then re-display them on the second panel (most recent member).

* Note: Don't worry about using client-side saving just yet. Just focus on getting the text inside the inputs and then displaying them via html in the second panel.
