With your group, answer each of the following questions using the ReactJS Documentation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part I:
1. What are the benefits of using ReactJS?

2. What is the significance of the React.createClass() method?
 * Creates a component 

3. What is the significance of the ReactDOM.render() function?

6. What is Babel? And what role does it play in converting JSX into vanilla JavaScript?
 * Compilier 

7. What is the significance of { } curly braces in JSX? (Hint: See "JSX in Depth")
 * Allow us to pass in JavaScript expressions {}

8. What is the difference between a prop and a state? (Hint: See articles on "Thinking in React", "Interactivity and Dynamic UIs")
