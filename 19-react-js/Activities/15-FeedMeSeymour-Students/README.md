* **Instructions:**

  * Using the folder slacked out as a starting point, update the code to match the functionality of the "Feed Me Seymour" game shown just now.

  * Your game should be composed of one parent component (AudreyII) and three child components (Tasty Treats).

  * Clicking the images inside of the child components should increase the total "consumed" shown in AudreyII's component by different amounts.

  * Once AudreyII has consumed more than 500 an alert should be triggered saying something like: "AudreyII is full!"
