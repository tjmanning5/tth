* **Instructions:**

  * Using the folder slacked out as a starting point, create a simple application using ReactJS, composed of four components (`app.js`, `Child.js`, `Parent.js`, and `Grandchild.js`)

  * Have it so `Parent.js` deploys `Child.js`, and `Child.js` deploys `Grandchild.js`.

  * Your application should ultimately display three Bootstrap panels, each inside of the other. The starter code already includes a Bootstrap CDN.

  * Hint: You can see an example of a Bootstrap panel here: <http://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels-heading>
