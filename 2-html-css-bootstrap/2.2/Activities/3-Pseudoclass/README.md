#:Pseudoclasses

* Assignment

  * Create a series of links and modify the pseudo-classes associated with their Default, Active, Hover, and Focus States.
  
  * Hint: Nope. No starter code. Gotta do this from scratch :-) 

##BonuS 

  * If you finish early, incorporate a pseudo-class we haven’t covered in your page. Then read about “pseudo-elements” and try to incorporate one as well.

  * Slack out the code and screenshot if you end up completing the bonus. 
  * **Extra** - Learn about css transitions to add a fading hover effect to a link (\<a\>)
