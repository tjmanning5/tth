* **Instructions:**

  * Install the Node package `node-debug` globally on your machine by running `npm install node-debug -g`.

  * Then open any Node program we've worked on to date and add the keyword `debugger` in various places.

  * Then run the program by typing `node-debug <NAME OF PROGRAM>`.

  * Experiment with the resulting node-debug interface to step through the code.

  * Note: `node-debug` can be a bit buggy. If it works for you... Great! If it doesn't, don't sweat it. You can always just `console.log` when debugging your Node applications.
