# GeoNodeInstructions

  * Create a Node application which makes use of the "geocoder" NPM package to obtain detailed geocoding information about a location.

  * Then `console.log` the geocoding information to display in your terminal.

  * You can choose to make one of two assumptions when completing this application.

    * Easier Option: The user will always provide a location in the following format: "City, State" (example: "Atlanta, GA", "Houston, TX").

    * Harder Option: The user can provide a location in any format. In fact, they can even provide a landmark instead of an address. ("151 Sip Ave, Jersey City NJ", "The Eiffel Tower", etc.)

  * Remember to log the output using `JSON.stringify` in a pretty-print format.
