* **Instructions:**
	* Using the code from the previous random number generator as a starting point, create a lottery generator.

	* In our case, the lottery number should pick 9 random numbers (and always 9 numbers). As an example: 886563264.

	* Display this number in the random-number div.

	* Then when a user clicks again, have the code create a new row with the latest number at the top.
