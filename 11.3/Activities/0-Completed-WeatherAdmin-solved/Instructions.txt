Instructions:

1. Create a command line interface application using Node.js (either with inquirer or process.argv).

2. The application should lead the user to one of two pathways: an Admin View or a User View.

3. The User View should prompt the user to provide their Name and the Location they'd like weather information for. Upon completion, the User should get the weather in Fahrenheits at that location.  

4. The Admin View should simply provide an array of every user's search while also including the "date" of each search. See sample below:
  
  [{"Ahmed", "Atlanta", "10-15-16"}, {"Adri", "Newark", "10-12-16"}, {"Joe", "Omaha", "10-10-16"}]

Using process.argv the command might be for user to get weather: 
	User Jim Orlando 
For Admin to get recent searches list the command is simply: 
	Admin

Notes:

1. In order to complete this activity you will need to make use of:

  - The weather-js npm package.

  - Two constructors: One for "UserSearch" and one for "WeatherAdmin".

  - A third file called CLI.js, which will be the main application logic.

  - Recent searches can be saved to a .txt file or stored as variables for one time use

2. This activity borrows from all of the concepts we've covered this week. Pay attention to the following activities:

  - Classroom Example (11.2)

  - Weather-js Example (10.2)
