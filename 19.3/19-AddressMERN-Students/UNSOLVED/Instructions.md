* **Instructions:**

  * Over the course of the next 1 hour and 15 minutes, you and your group will be "upgrading" the React application provided to incorporate MongoDB and Server integration. Your final application, should include a new React component for listing out the last five search terms and the date-time in which they were searched.

  * The activity is challenging, but it is very much a REAL-WORLD problem similar to ones you will have to solve in your career, so take your best shot!

  * As you proceed, consider the following as advice:

    * Divide your team into pairs. One pair will work on creating the front-end of the React application with the ability to capture data input. The second will create an initial server and API. Once you have both these pieces, work together to create the helper functions necessary to make HTTP requests to your API.

    * Remember the general steps involved with incorporating a database into a React application:

      * Add a server.js file.

      * Update your package list.

      * Add a database.

      * Add a model.

      * Add a set of API routes.

      * Create lifecycle events.

      * Use `axios` to perform HTTP requests to an API.

      * Test, debug, test, debug, test, debug...

  * Reach out to the Instructors / TAs as you have questions.

  * Push yourselves! This will be a hard hour!
