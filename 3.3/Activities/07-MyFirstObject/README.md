* **Instructions**

    * With a partner, spend the next few moments studying the code: `Saturday/3.3/Activities/07-MyFirstObject/car-object-unsolved.html` 

    * Then write code below each comment to log the relevant information about the provided `car` object.

    * Bonus: If you finish early, create a brand new object of your own. Slack out a snippet of the code to the class when you are done. Be creative!
