#Instructions

  * Working in pairs and using the starter file (`Saturday/3.3/Activities/03-MyFirstFunctions/my-first-functions-unsolved.html`), fill in the missing functions and function calls.`

  * Note: Try to finish all four functions if you can, but donâ€™t be distressed if you only get one or two. The important thing is that you get at least one function fully done.

  * Hint: Look back to the previous example if you need help.
