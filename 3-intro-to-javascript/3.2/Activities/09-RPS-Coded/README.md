* **Instructions**:

    * In groups of 4, begin the process of coding out the rock-paper-scissors game.

    * Do as much as you can on your own, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you feel your team is struggling.

    * **Note**: Don't use `document.write` as it will delete the contents of the body, including your javascript. Instead, use `document.getElementById` in conjunction with the `textContent` property, as you were shown earlier.

    * **Note**: Don’t worry. _We know this is a very challenging assignment_. We also know that you won’t know where to start. In fact, we haven’t shown you EVERYTHING you need yet, but that’s okay. Part of being a developer is figuring things out on your own through trial and error.
