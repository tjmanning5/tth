 * **Instructions**

    * Starting from scratch, create a `for` loop that console logs the following lines:
    ```
    I am 0
    I am 1
    I am 2
    I am 3
    I am 4
    ```
    * Don't use an array!

##Part 2
    
  * Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and that logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:
  ```
  var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
  ```

  * Then check if the first letter in the animal's name begins with a "c" or "o." If it does, create an alert saying, "Starts with 'c' or 'o'!"

  * **Hint**: You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element of an array.
