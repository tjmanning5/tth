#Intro to Console/Bash


##From the Terminal/Console, using only the command line, create the following:
1. A new folder with the name of first-day-stuff
1. A new HTML file with the name of first-day.html
1. Open the current folder containing the new HTML file.

##BONUS
* Create multiple directories/folders with the names `one_folder` and `second_folder` using a _single command_.

* Create multiple files with the names `one.html` and `two.html` in the `first_day_stuff` directory using a _single command_.
